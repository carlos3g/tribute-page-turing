      <h2>Here's a time line of Turing's life:</h2>
      <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li><span>1912</span> - Born in Maida Vale, London.</li>
        <li>
          <span>1926</span> - At the age of 13, Alan Turing first showed signs
          of intelligence and potential which was noticed at the Sherborne
          School.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1931</span> - Alan Turing studied from 1931 to 1934 at King's
          College, in Cambridge. He was first in his class and was an honor
          student in the field of mathematics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1936</span> - Turing studied mathematics and cryptology while
          also building three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary
          multiplier at Princeton University.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1939</span> - Turing helped to solve the essential part of the
          German naval indicator system and also came up with the idea of
          sequential analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1940</span> - Turing was responsible for creating the Bombe
          which was a cryptanalytic machine used to decrypt the
          Enigma-enciphered messages being sent from the enemies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1942</span> - Turing traveled to the United States to work with
          the US naval cryptanalysts to create their version of the Bombe and an
          Enigma in Washington.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1946</span> - He presented his paper in February of 1946 where
          he had presented the first detailed design of a stored program
          computer setup.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1947</span> - Turing lived in Hampton, London where worked on
          the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine).
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1948</span> - Turing created the LU decomposition method that
          was used and is still used today to solve matrix equations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1948</span> - Turing was appointed a position in the mathematics
          department at the University of Manchester where he worked on software
          for one of the earliest stored-program computers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1950</span> - The turing test was created in 1950. The turing
          test was created to compare the intelligence of a machine/computer to
          the intelligence of a human brain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1952</span> - Turing was caught in a relationship with an
          unemployed 19 year old man. He was convicted for indecency because
          homosexual acts were considered criminal offences in the United
          Kingdom at the time. This is what lead to his downhill spiral right
          before his suicide.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1952</span> - Turing's book "The Chemical Basis of
          Morphogenesis" was published in 1952 which was all about his interest
          in the biology of organisms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1954</span> - Turing committed suicide in his house where his
          housekeeper found him dead.
        </li>
      </ul>
